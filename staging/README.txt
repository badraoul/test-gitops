I based this example upon a demo I found here: https://antonputra.com/kubernetes/kubernetes-kustomize-tutorial/

When I tried to run the command 'kubectl apply -k staging' from my command line, I get an error that 'base' should be a file.  
I tried to run this in TMC, and the error was 'could not find ConfigMap', so something is going on mapping.
